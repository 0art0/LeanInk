LeanInk is a [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) tool for static code visualization through the integration of [Alectryon](https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon).
During the development of LeanInk, we also implement changes to Alectryon itself. Until further notice, these changes are developed in the following fork: [Alectryon Fork](https://github.com/insightmind/alectryon/tree/lean4)

More information coming soon!
